# Battleship
is a single-player browser version of the popular board game. The tiles are randomly generated and appended to the DOM with JavaScript. 

A new board instance is generated each time the game is played, and each tile on the board is mapped to a matching position in a 2d array. There are 17 ship tiles that must be found in order to win. Players may 'miss' a total of 27 tiles before losing the game.

>To play:
Simply run the app in localhost and open your browser on the specified port. Have fun!
