# StarFleets
is a single-player browser-based version of the popular board game, Battleship. A new board instance is generated each time the game is loaded, and each tile on the board is mapped to a matching position in a 2-dimensional array. There are 14 corresponding 'starfleet' tiles that must be found and destroyed in order to win. In total, there are four fleets of varying sizes; from 2 tiles, all the way up to 5. The starfleet positions are randomly generated and each position in the array is looped over and appended to the DOM as a button. Players are given a total of 27 projectiles at the start of each game. A loss will occur if a player runs out of projectiles before every starfleet is destroyed.
