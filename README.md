# StarFleets
is a single-player browser-based version of the popular board game, Battleship. A new board instance is generated each time the game is loaded, and each tile on the board is mapped to a matching position in a 2-dimensional array. There are 17 corresponding 'starfleet' tiles that must be found and destroyed in order to win. The tiles are randomly generated and appended to the DOM with JavaScript.  Players are given a total of 27 projectiles at the start of each game. A loss will occur if a player runs out of projectiles before every starfleet is destroyed.
